Blood Sample

Procedure
A blood sample of approximately 70 ml in total was taken on the first day after the acquisition of the MRI data. The blood was collected with four different types of sampling tubes: Serum, EDTA, Citrate and RNA. A part of the sample was directly sent on the day of drawing to the Institute for Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics (ILM) of Medical Faculty at the Leipzig University, the remaining samples were stored for later use. One serum tube (S-Monovette® 7.5 ml, Sarstedt), one EDTA tube  (S-Monovette® 2.7 ml K3E, Sarstedt), and one citrate tube (S-Monovette® 3.0 ml 9NC, Sarstedt) were sent for direct analysis to the ILM. The remaining blood samples were divided into 10 microtainers of 2,0 ml size. Together with three EDTA tubes  (S-Monovette® 2.7 ml K3E, Sarstedt) and 2 RNA tubes (TempusTM , Applied Biosystems ) - containing  stabilization solution - the remaining blood samples were stored at -80° C for later use.
The date of blood drawing is mentioned at the beginning (Assessment Day 1, or Day 1+x days, in case it was taken at another day).
