\title{Randomize (permute) the rows of a matrix}
\usage{
rand_rows_cpp(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix to permute}
}
\value{
a matrix with the rows of \code{X} reordered
}
\description{
The C++ implementation gives this function more speed than the \code{rand_rows()}
function written in just in R.
This function randomizes or permutes a matrix by reordering complete rows of
the matrix. This results in a matrix where the relationships (correlations)
within the matrix are preserved. But when compared to another matrix with different
variables and the same participants, the relationships between the two matrices
are now broken.
}
\details{
This function is the option used when selecting "rand_rows" in the stopping rule
functions such as \code{\link[=SRP]{SRP()}} or \code{\link[=DRP]{DRP()}}.
